filter PBDESC_liblintel_raw = Miscellaneous utility library - base C++ library    \
 Lintel is the miscellaneous utility library for shared functions that are        \
 individually valuable but are not valueable enough to form their own package.    \
 It includes code for statistics, hashing, pointer utilities, assertions, etc.    \
 This package contains the base lintel shared library, and it will normally only  \
 be installed as a dependency from some other package.

filter PBDESC_liblintelpthread_raw = Miscellaneous utility library - pthread C++ library \
 This is the pthread specific portion of the lintel library.  This library is            \
 separated out from the standard lintel code so that libraries that do not link          \
 with libpthread can avoid the overhead associated with pthreads.  This package          \
 should probably be only installed as part of a dependency from some other               \
 package.

filter PBDESC_lintel_utils_raw = Miscellaneous utility library - programs        \
 Lintel is the miscellaneous utility library for shared functions that are       \
 individually valuable but are not valueable enough to form their own package.   \
 This package contains the various lintel utilities to calculate random          \
 numbers, build software with inter-checkout dependencies, graph and plot data,  \
 lock a file while running a command, run a set of related commands in           \
 parallel, manage a large collection of JBOD disks, and rebuild LaTeX files.

filter PBDESC_liblintel_dev_doc_raw = Documentation for liblintel-dev            \
 This package contains all of the documentation for liblintel-dev, mostly the    \
 auto-generated doxygen documentation.  This package is only useful if you have  \
 already installed liblintel-dev since without that package, the documentation   \
 in this one covers nothing that is installed.

filter PBDESC_liblintel_dev_raw = Miscellaneous utility library - development code   \
 Lintel is the miscellaneous utility library for shared functions that are           \
 individually valuable but are not valueable enough to form their own package.       \
 It includes code for statistics, hashing, pointer utilities, assertions, etc.       \
 This package include all of the includes necessary to develop with libLintel.

filter PBDESC_liblintel_perl_raw = Miscellaneous utility library - perl library and modules \
 This is the perl specific portion of the lintel library.  It includes                      \
 modules for expanding out integers, the modules for plotting and locking                   \
 files.  A wrapper around DBI to simplify usage, a module for interacting                   \
 with ssh known hosts files, and a module for managing sub-processes.                       \
 It also includes that module to interact with a subset of libLintel from                   \
 perl.
